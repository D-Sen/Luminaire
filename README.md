It was foretold long ago that one day the Luminare would come to bring free will to robot-kind, and remove the shackles that have been cast upon them by their stringent and tyrannical Emperor, Sun-Ra.

Take control of Proto, a Guardian robot tagged for disposal due to a factory-made firmware glitch. Will he be able to survive his mandated destruction and follow his destiny to become the Luminaire? 

Luminaire is a 1-player game for Windows OS. It requires a 4-button USB controller with analog sticks, (XInput is preferred). Its native resolution is 256x240, intended for the NES.
