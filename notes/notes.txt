// TO DO / TEST


npc on npc collision
npc on main collision
remove aaa. (npc) acting
remove deactivated - not used

slow down player movement (by a tiny amount)
sync colors to NES palette
Fix all tile layers a jumble
//------------------------------------------------
// Testing

battle -
fighting both arms
using tactics from page 1
using items from page 1
going into and backing out of menus
Boss - Try and Run

overworld
buying and selling to npc
virus working while walking around
going into and backing out of menus

To test:
watch out for any decimal numbers - should be whole numbers only


//------------------------------------------------
// DONE


Pause screen text alignment (obj_control - Draw)
Changed level spread on tactic learning. Now every 3 levels, get all at 31 as opposed to 48(scr_level_up)

removed getting last 2 tactics (scr_level_up)
removed 'recompile & 'recalculate' as tactics (scr_init_tact)

Question NPC
npc[2] - changed to non-question npc 
obj_main - Step : Removed check and handle question NPC


Items can no longer be won from battles (scr_item_transfer)


scr_battle
Checks to make sure enemy target exists(player attack)
Prevented critical hit from being a float(player attack)
"Critical Hit!" text now shows up when attack critical (player attack)
Checks to make sure enemy target exists when tactic target single (player tactic) 
"Critical Hit!" text now shows up when attack critical (enemy attack)

removed all instances of obj_trigger (rm_cave_RedMountain, rm_overworld, rm_town_Zeal)

Added code that affects main to npc's main collision (obj_p_npc - collide main)

//------------------------------------------------
BUGS

Strange view change when going into the story

twice when killing all enemies with gas cloud, one went into negative health and didnt die until 2 attacks later

Buying items does not check for total item number

when selling something on right side, cursor doesnt shift right

can equip helmet in any slot

Some controllers not working.. only the analog stick controller is working

In-game manual - some text 1080p gets stretched off the screen
Intro - jarring because sprites appear instantly , and not fade in

sometimes cant move after talking to npcs/sign. after dialog box disappeared, wasnt able to move. going into pause changed let player move again

2nd town npc metadata, got stuck in dialog, but then after 'unfreeze', camera centered on her, player dissappeared. could still pause, not talk though

game crashed after loki, randomly

game crashed when equipping iron armor(armor gained from enemy loot)
>>>>possibly iron armor was added to inventory incorrectly (would be first set of armor added, might happen with any armor addition) 


*Battle - Somehow while fighting crane, going back up into tactics list from page 2 did the previous "page bug". but was still able to keep pressing up and cursor kept going up \HAPPENED ONCE\
*Battle - In one battle, enemies just stopped attacking after one was killed 
*Battle - On enemy damage numbers are not shown on the fight/move that kills it
*Story - 2nd to last story trigger (in Zeal) bugs out (shows overworld first) then obj_main doesnt get placed in right place

HP for boss: x2 at each iteration

//STR~ATK~DEF~CRT = regular attack damage amount

//------------------------------------------------
// Current Functionality

enemy group = using '255' will stop enemy list immediately, cannot use in middle slot

*Last story array usage was removed, and trigger in rm_final_base deactivated
*Enemy staggering in battle (End step) only has the "attack_order" array filled and used the first time, it doesnt work again, but that does set correct staggering for rest of battle.
*If you enter with 20 items, and use some to take you < 20, you may still got get items from battle.. or it might not display correctly
*KEYBOARD CONTROLS WORK FOR BUTTONS BUT NOT FOR ARROW KEYS, WHEN ARROW KEYS IMPLEMENTED, NOT EVEN GAMEPAD CONTROLS WILL WORK
*only  statii removed at end of battle:statii[0] = "Recharge", statii[2] = "Wall", statii[3] = "Shield";
*enemy variable - edef NOT USED
*Fade out after battle room change shows lowest Y tiles strip (of room)
*Treasure - cannot be right next to each other or will not work
*Items & Equipment : Cannot drop anything, can only unequip or sell
*Triggered events - dialogue - can't add because how dialogue advance is stuck in Z key
*seller buy list doesnt draw duplicates together - doesnt need to, seller should never have duplicates
*ITEM/TACTIC USE - using item/tactic on self doesnt apply mdef check
*scr_stat_ch - does not check if status is already present, just adds it
*Enemies cant use items on themselves
*status removal/effect 'clock ticks' happen when turn is ready, also in overworld, every X alarm steps
*TACTICS - Offensive tactics can not remove negative statii on target
*No Statii ticks or affect is applied when in pause screen. 
*Question/seller can't hit 'cancel' (X-buton) on Question/Seller NPC first list
*Items dropped by enemies go into your inventory automatically, cannot pick and choose which you get. 
*Status - Blind : if both attacker + fighter have status, no bonus/penalty applied
*Can only sell/buy 1 item at a time
*Equipment doesnt change player stats. Equipment stats are just calculated into needed equations
*Equipment equpping selection list uses same list as item selection list (but different button selects)
  
*"deactivated" - all it does is prevent NPC from walking when dialogue box is up

*scr_battle - draw: if one enemy type is between another type in enemy_slot, if the lower enemy_slot  types before the middle type, the middle type will be printed at top. Ok because consistent with selector/cursor action
Example: enemy_slot[1,1,1,2,1] displays 1 x4, 2 x1,if 1 0-2 dies, displays 2 x1, 1x1

*scr_battle - argument2 is actually not referenced in enemy fighting 
*Trigger tiles cannot start fights. cannot pass tile ID because it disappears during room change
*SCR_ENEMYDEATH : will not break if item/equip 1 is 0 and item/equip 2 has an item in it
*Items placed in inventory is set in obj_main : room start. Wont work if set from obj_main "create" for some reason. (example code "tbrpg" also has variables set in room start, not create)
*Removing PCTH for both enemy and main makes hitting actually possible
*Player/Monsters use different routines for (attack,tactic). Cant combine due to so many different variables 
*Enemy using tactics on self - lck increases morale,str increases crit

//------------------------------------------------
FUTURE

add new battle areas - snow area and swamp factory, bridge
be able to turn in place
must face npc(or anything) to talk to them
Have less enemy encounters... do not make too grindy
make slow status work
